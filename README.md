# AdeRawl
## Available at [https://aderawl.megalonvii.repl.co/](https://aderawl.megalonvii.repl.co/)

Hosted using Replit + UptimeRobot (Source code also available [here](https://replit.com/@megalonvii/AdeRawl).)

## How to Create
- Create a [Replit](https://repl.it/) account.
- Create a Flask repl.
- `git clone` this repository.
- Replace the `main.py` file in the repl with the `main.py` you just cloned. Done by drag and drop.
- Drag and drop the `templates` folder into your repl.
- (Optional) Edit the timezone at the bottom of `main.py`. It is in accordance with the [pytz timezones](https://gist.github.com/heyalexej/8bf688fd67d7199be4a1682b3eec7568).
- (Optional) In `templates/index.html`, edit any of the links to email and donation if necessary.
- Create an [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) account.
- Create a new monitor on Uptime. Choose the monitor as "HTTP(S)".
- Friendly name the monitor whatever you'd like, make sure the URL is the link available in Webview in your repl!
- In order to run this for free, I'd recommend having a monitor interval of 5 minutes, though if you want you can pay for a faster monitor interval.
- Done! Use your repl's link for yourself and/or send it to your friends!
